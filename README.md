# Credit Risk Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: The purpose of this analysis was to oversample, undersample, over and undersample in combination then use different machine learning approaches to determine if these methods should be used to predict credit risk for individuals looking to get loans

## Results: Comparison of balanced accuracy scores, precision and recall scores of each learning model
- RandomOverSampler
- SMOTE
- ClusterCentroids
- SMOTEENN
- BalancedRandomForestClassifier
- EasyEnsembleClassfier


## Summary: Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
